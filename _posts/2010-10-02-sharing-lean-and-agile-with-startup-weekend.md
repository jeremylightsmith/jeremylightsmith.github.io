I am fortunate enough to be hanging out with [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org) Organizers and [Startup Digest](http://thestartupdigest.com) Curators from around the world this weekend. It's called the [SO Summit](http://www.sosummit.com/), and there's a lot of energy in the room!

I just gave a talk on Lean &amp; Agile and what they might look like at a startup weekend.

Here's a link to the [presentation](/files/2010/lean_agile_at_startup_weekend.pdf).
