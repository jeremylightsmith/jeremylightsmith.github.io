My 5 roommates and I spent 4 1/2 years coming up with a system for keeping our house clean that works. And we did! More importantly, we think we know how it works.

Our chore chart is a self healing system, and it shares characteristics with other self healing systems. It:
* uses simple rules
* expects &amp; tolerates faults
* visualizes work
* encourages forgiveness
* discourages heroes
* is gameable

Perhaps the same traits that are keeping my house clean can ensure you deliver value to your customers.

Watch a lightning talk I gave about this system at SeaSPIN earlier this evening :
