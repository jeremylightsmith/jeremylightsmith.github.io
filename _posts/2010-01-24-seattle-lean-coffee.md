[Jim Benson](http://ourfounder.typepad.com/) and I are starting [Seattle Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org) on Wednesdays from 8:30am-10am at Uptown Espresso on Westlake & Republican.

We'll be talking about things like *visualizing work*, *limiting WIP*, and *self organizing teams! If you're in Seattle, join us this and every Wednesday morning!

### What is Lean?

If you're not familiar with Lean - people in the Agile & Scrum communities often describe it as all the lightweight, pragmatic, evidence based approaches that Agile has, but in language that makes sense to a CEO. In fact, it goes beyond Agile and has been translated across many industries, actually starting in Toyota's manufacturing and supply chain. Today many of the fastest moving software teams that use Agile & Scrum are also adopting Lean thinking to get even better.
