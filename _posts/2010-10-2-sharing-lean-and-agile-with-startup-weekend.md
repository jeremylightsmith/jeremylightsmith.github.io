I am fortunate enough to be hanging out with <a href="http://startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend</a> Organizers and <a href="http://thestartupdigest.com">Startup Digest</a> Curators from around the world this weekend. It's called the <a href="http://www.sosummit.com/">SO Summit</a>, and there's a lot of energy in the room!

I just gave a talk on Lean &amp; Agile and what they might look like at a startup weekend.

We did a couple mind maps of what makes a startup team successful or not. Feel free to add to them!
