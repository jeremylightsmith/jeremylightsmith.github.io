        <p>
          For over 20 years, I've helped software teams deliver more value and find happiness at work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've done this by writing good code, helping teams design their process, holding conflict, and sharing
          tools. I am just as much at home writing code with developers as I am in the board room and am just as happy
          to follow as to lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm looking for a developer position where my leadership and process background can make a big impact.
