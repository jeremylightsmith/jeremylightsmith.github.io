        <p>
          For over 20 years, I've helped software teams deliver more value and find happiness at work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've done this by writing good code, steering technical direction, mediating conflict, and helping teams
          design their process. I'm just as much at home writing code with developers as I am in the boardroom, and
          just as happy to follow as to lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm looking for a developer position where my leadership and process background can make a big impact.

          I saw the team through a rewrite of their entire codebase from Ruby+Angular to a much more stable and scalable Elixir+Liveview.
          I personally led the building and design of the heart of the product, the importer. I also led the team in the hardening and performance 
          tuning of our core product as our business grew even as we worked to replace it.
